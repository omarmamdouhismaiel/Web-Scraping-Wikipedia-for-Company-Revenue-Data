# Web Scraping Wikipedia for Company Revenue Data
Scrape the revenue data tables from the Wikipedia page [_"List of largest companies in the United States by revenue"_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_in_the_United_States_by_revenue), load the data into Pandas DataFrames, and export it to CSV files.
